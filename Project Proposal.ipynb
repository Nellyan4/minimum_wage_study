He served as a dishwasher for almost two years in the campus cafeteria. The hourly rate for a student dishwasher at the University of Washington is 16 dollar, a little bit higher than the Washington State minimum wage. When he begins his graduate study at Carnegie Mellon University, he serves as the Teaching Assistant of one of the Statistics Classes, his hourly rate for being a Teaching Assistant is 15 dollar, a dollar less than his previous job as a dishwasher. He then found out that the minimum wage of Pennsylvania State is only 7.25 dollar. At that moment, Xi Yan was irritated and wanted to rather work as a dishwasher in Washington State.\n","\n","It is unfair, that we all live in the United States, and the prices for commodities and foods do not vary a lot from state to state. The minimum wage, however, in some states is over 100% than some other states.\n","\n","However, the State of Pennsylvania persists in keeping the minimum wage to be $7.25 for decades. People are urging an increase in the minimum wage, yet some scholars argue that a minimum wage increase is not necessary or it would not affect labor productivity or it would even make people be lazier.\n","\n","Therefore, in this project, we want to know **how does (increasing) the minimum wage really affects people and the industry?** Is it necessary for a state government to increase the minimum wage? If we are able to figure this out, we could draft a policy memo to propose our idea to the state governors so they might be able to return benefits to all hard-working workers.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TxO_0W9ZTSLv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Related Work\n","\n","We find out about this topic through our personal experience and also the increasing minimum wage topic is popular in the State of Pennsylvania.
